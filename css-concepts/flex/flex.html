    <title>CSS FlexBOX- Frontend Fighters</title>
</head>
<!-- flexbox came in css to align items efficiently and in an easy manner -->
<!-- there is a flex container
inside that there are :
main start - horizontally from where container started
main end- horizontally where container ends
flex items - items as children in flex container
main size = distance between main end and main start
cross start - vertical start position of flex container
cross end - vertical end position of flex container
cross size = distance between cross end and cross start

:NOTE: 
above given all params are for flex container whose
flex direction property is horizontal(by default)

and if we set it to the vertical then the main end/start is for vertical and
cross start/end for horizontal -->

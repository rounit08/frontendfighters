    Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that focuses on the meaning of the content rather than its presentation. By
    using semantic HTML, you can create web pages that are more accessible, easier to maintain, and better for search
    engine optimization.

    Here are some principles of semantic HTML:

    Use the appropriate HTML tags for their intended purpose: Each HTML tag has a specific purpose, and using them
    appropriately can help make your code more meaningful. For example, use <h1> for your main heading and <p> for
            paragraphs of text.

            Use descriptive class and ID names: When you need to add a class or ID to an HTML element, choose names that
            describe the content, not just the presentation. This can make your code more understandable for other
            developers and help with search engine optimization.

            Use headings in order: Use headings from
        <h1> to <h6> in order, with <h1> being the most important heading on the page. This helps convey the structure
                    and hierarchy of your content.

                    Use lists for related content: Use <ul> and <ol> tags for lists of related content, such as a list
                            of features or a set of instructions. This helps convey the relationship between the items
                            in the list.

                            Use semantic tags: HTML5 introduced new semantic tags such as <header>, <footer>, <nav>, and
                                        <article> that can make your code more meaningful. Use them where appropriate to
                                            convey the structure and meaning of your content.

                                            By following these principles, you can create HTML that is more meaningful
                                            and accessible for both humans and machines. This can improve the usability
                                            and findability of your web pages and make them easier to maintain over
                                            time.

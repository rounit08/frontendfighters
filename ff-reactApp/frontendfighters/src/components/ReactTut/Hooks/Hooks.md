There are two types of component in React:

1 CLASS based => earlier used to make Dynamic UI
2 Functional => earlier used to make static UI

After updates Functional comps get more famous
so to make dynamic UI with React, Meta announces Hooks in V16.
With hooks we can carryout the lifecycle methods to the functional component
